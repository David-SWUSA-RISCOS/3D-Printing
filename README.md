# 3D-Printing


This repository is for both software and 3D-Models related to 3D Printing.

Most of what will be put in this repository will be 3D-Printable models, and some that are just mostly 3D-Printable.  The goal is to share useful designs, especially the components most do not print as printable usable models (bolts, nuts, clip connectors, etc).  Do to the positive properties for such things many items will best print in PLA with a layer height of between 0.05mm and 0.1mm (thin layers).

Overall this Repo will have various types of bolts, nuts, clipping edge designs, springs, complete bearings, rails, and other things people do not think to print that can be printed (and NOT PURCHASED).  PLA has many advantages, including being a renuable material, we are in this for the long hull (not to help deplete resources).

Most items are created using OpenSCAD, as it is the 3D modeling software I am best able to work with.  As such the OpenSCAD file will be included along with the STL files for printing.

One eventual goal is to provide enough parts that if you have the controller board (including drivers), Steppers, three low cost motors (for the fans), a J-Head hot end (low cost, easy to cool), and a peice of glass you will be able to print ALL other parts of the printer.  That is there will be ZERO need of any kind of pre-made fasteners, pre-made fans, etc.  The goal is to be able to print a complete 3D-printer (minus the few things mentioned above) in under 2KG of PLA.  There is the eventual goal of going a step furthur and adding a Wax extruder and hot end to create parts to be used to lost wax mold the metal for things like the hot-end, thus increasing the amount of the printer that is 3D-Printed (a step closer to full RepRap in nature).

On the software side this will likely include some software for Macintosh System Software and some for RISC OS.
