# Nuts and Bolts:

Most of these are simple triangular threaded nuts and bolts.

Most models assume that your printer is capable of printing with an edge tollorance between two fitting parts of 0.1mm or better.  If your printer is not able to accomplish this get the SCAD files and modify the tollorance setting, and export a new STL for your use.
