# Nuts and Bolts:

Most of these are simple triangular threaded nuts and bolts.  All bolts have inside drive (like hex key bolts) of either square or triangle profile.  Nuts are either square outside or have two pin type drive.

The part names for bolts are in the form of (in order):
* DrvType : SqrDrv for Square drive and TriDrv for tirangle Drive, this is followed by the size of the drive hole.
* H..mm   : Head diameter where the .. is replced by the head diameter in mm.
* L..mm   : The length of the threaded shaft in mm.
* D..mm   : The outside diameter of the threaded shaft in mm.
* P..mm   : The thread pitch in mm per thread (eg 0.5 is 2 threads per mm or 20 threads per cm).
* .stl    : File name extension for crude ancient style Operating Systems that use the file extension to determine the file type.


Most models assume that your printer is capable of printing with an edge tollorance between two fitting parts of 0.1mm or better.  If your printer is not able to accomplish this get the SCAD files and modify the tollorance setting, and export a new STL for your use.
